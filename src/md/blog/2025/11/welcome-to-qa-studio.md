We're excited to introduce QA Studio - a modern, open-source test management platform designed from the ground up by QA engineers who understand the pain points of existing solutions.

## Why We Built QA Studio

Traditional test management tools are bloated, slow, and expensive. They're built for managers, not for the engineers doing the actual testing. We wanted something different:

- **Lightning Fast**: Built with modern tech that's actually fast
- **API First**: Every feature accessible via REST API
- **Developer Friendly**: Integrates seamlessly with your CI/CD pipeline
- **Open Source**: Free to use, modify, and self-host

## Getting Started

Getting started with QA Studio is simple:

1. **Create a Project**: Organize your testing by project
2. **Add Test Cases**: Create comprehensive test cases with steps and expected results
3. **Run Tests**: Execute test runs across different environments
4. **Track Results**: Monitor pass rates and identify bottlenecks

## Flexible Pricing

- **Free Tier**: Start with one project, unlimited test cases
- **Self-Hosted**: Deploy on your own infrastructure for unlimited everything
- **Pro Plan**: Unlimited projects, team collaboration, and AI-powered diagnostics

## What's Next?

We're constantly improving QA Studio based on feedback from real QA engineers. Check out our [API documentation](/docs) to start integrating with your existing tools.
