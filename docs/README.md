## 📝 Contributing Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. **Place in `/docs` directory** - All markdown docs should live here
2. **Update this README** - Add your doc to the appropriate section
3. **Use clear headings** - Make docs easy to navigate
4. **Include code examples** - Show, don't just tell
5. **Link related docs** - Help users find related information

### Documentation Standards

- Use relative links between docs
- Include a "Table of Contents" for long docs
- Add troubleshooting sections where applicable
- Keep security docs up to date with code changes
